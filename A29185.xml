         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE MINISTERS OF ENGLAND VVhich are called <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> weighed in the ballance of Equity.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I began to conſider of theſe things, and weighed them in the ballance of Equity and Truth; my ſoul within me was troubled, to hear the cry amongſt the People concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> ſome crying this is a <hi>Miniſter</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> another that; and while I was meditating on theſe things, the Lord God, that made Heaven and Earth, by his Spirit ſaid unto me, Weigh them in my ballance of Equity, compare them with my Servants and <hi>Miniſters</hi> in former ages, and ſee whether they be in their <hi>Call, Practiſe,</hi> and <hi>Doctrine,</hi> agreeable to my Servants; which if they be not, let the People underſtand and know thereof, that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as deſires after the way of life, and ſalvation, may be deceived no longer, and the reſt may be left without excuſe.</p>
            <p>Then I began to conſider how the Miniſters and Servants of the Lord, were ſent forth in former ages, whether they were ſent to the <hi>Schools</hi> to learn, that they might be fitted to do the Lords work, or be his <hi>Miniſters;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Amos</hi> 1.1.</note> and I could not find in all the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37413:3"/> 
               <hi>Scriptures</hi> of Truth, that the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> were ſent to the <hi>Schools</hi> of <hi>Learning,</hi> with an intention thereby to be made <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.16 17.</note> but they were called forth from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and imployments, and were endued with power from on high, by him that ſent them, to perform the ſervice they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.</p>
            <p>But they who are commonly called the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> are ſent to the <hi>Schools</hi> to learn the <hi>Tongues,</hi> and <hi>Languages,</hi> and that they ſay fits them to be <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> which many <hi>Tongues</hi> and <hi>Languages</hi> came in ſince tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen</hi> 11.7, 8, 9.</note> and the juſtice of God was executed upon them, who thought to make themſelves a Name, and build a Tower whoſe top might reach unto heaven; and now thoſe men called <hi>Miniſters,</hi> glory in their <hi>Tongues</hi> and <hi>Languages.</hi> Do they not glory when they ſay he is an able <hi>Miniſter,</hi> he hath the <hi>Tongues?</hi> here the <hi>Tongues</hi> makes them able, (as they ſay) here they take the glory from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and aſcribes it to the <hi>Tongues,</hi> which <hi>Tongues Chriſt</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deems out of,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9.</note> and ſo they glory in that which <hi>Chriſt</hi> redeems out of, which glory the <hi>Lord God</hi> of Heaven and Earth will ſtain, and ſhame and confuſion ſhall come upon them.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But ſayes the People, they may be Miniſters of Chriſt, though they learn the Tongues; was not</hi> Paul <hi>a Miniſter of Chriſt, and was not he brought up at the feet of</hi> Gamaliel? <hi>and had not the Apoſtles the gift of Tongues?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea, <hi>Paul</hi> was a <hi>Miniſter</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but the bringing up at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 22.3. to the 22.</note> did not make him a <hi>Miniſter</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is apparent, for after that he perſecuted the <hi>Church of God,</hi> until ſuch time as the Lord met with him, and called him by his grace, to be a <hi>Miniſter</hi> and a <hi>Witneſs</hi> for his Name. Then if it be the Lords work, to call and make <hi>Miniſters,</hi> then thoſe men who believe or think, that <hi>Tongues</hi> or <hi>Languages</hi> can make <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are in an error, and are ignorant of the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and aſcribe that to the <hi>Tongues</hi> and <hi>Languages</hi> (which at the beſt are but a gift) which is only due to God; though we do not forbid to ſpeak with <hi>Tongues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But then they ſay, you miſtake us, we do not aſcribe the glory to the Tongues, we uſe them but as a means.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> But if you uſe that as a means, after ſuch a manner as God
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37413:3"/> never ordained (to wit) that none without it can be made <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then you aſcribe that to the means which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belongs to God: and ſo would limit the holy one of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> to your means, and helps, your <hi>tongues</hi> and <hi>languages,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Which tongues the Beaſt had power over, <hi>Reve.</hi> 13.17.</note> that ſo none might be called <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but ſuch as you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of, who at the leaſt will give ſome honour to your <hi>tongues</hi> and <hi>languages;</hi> which makes the people idolize you, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der after you, but now you are weighed &amp; found too light, your glory will the Lord God of Heaven and Earth lay in the duſt, and he will call forth <hi>Servants</hi> and <hi>Miniſters</hi> by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> as in former ages, whom he will endue with his power from on high, that will glorifie him for ever.</p>
            <p>But further, when I began to conſider the life and practiſe of thoſe men, whether it might not be agreeable to the life and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and when I had conſidered the life of the <hi>Prophets</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they were <hi>holy</hi> men, and <hi>meek</hi> men, <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>ſober,</hi>

But nevertheleſs though it be thus with them in <hi>life</hi> and <hi>practiſe,</hi> for all this may not their Doctrine be good?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.48.</note> and then I began to conſider their <hi>Doctrine</hi> and compare ſome few of them with the <hi>Doctrine of Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles; Chriſt</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">

               <hi>we preach wiſdome among them that are perfect;</hi> mark that, (are perfect) was not that in this life? but do not theſe learned men ſay that none can be perfect in this life? the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaid, <hi>the Law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made me free from the law of ſin and death:

                  <hi>John</hi> 1.9: <hi>&amp;</hi> 8:12:</note> but do not they ſay, none can be made free from ſin in this life? John ſaid, <hi>that was the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the World;</hi> was not Chriſt that true light? who ſaid, <hi>I am come a light into the World, that whoſoever followeth me ſhould not abide in darkneſs, but ſhould have the light of life;</hi> but do not they ſay that every man is not lighted,<note place="margin">
